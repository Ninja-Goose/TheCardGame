    <string name="rules_text">Rules of the game:\n\n
At the start of each player’s Turn, they draw 2 cards from the Draw Pile.\n\nAt the start of each player’s Turn, they gain 20 Energy\n\n
If a player ends their Turn with extra Energy, they carry over to the next Turn, up to a maximum of 30 Energy\n\n
Each player has a Turn each Round, the order in which they happen alternates (If player one goes first on round one, they go second on round two).\n\n
When both players have ended their Turns, all Attacking cards attack, in the order from the Draw Pile out.\n\n
Black cards are classified as Attacking cards, and red cards are classified as Defending cards.\n\n
Each player has 50 Health\n\n
If an Attacking card is not completely blocked by a Defending card, the remaining damage reduces the player’s Health by the Attacking card’s damage, subtracted by any Defending card’s health.\n\n
To play a card on your Turn, you must have Energy equal or greater to the card’s value (i.e. playing a 4 of clubs requires 4 Energy)\n\n
When you play a card, reduce your Energy by the card’s value.\n\n
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King and Ace) cost 15 Energy to play.\n\n
Ace\n
Red Aces have 1 health but can make a Defending card invincible for the Round\n
Black Aces deal 1 damage but can remove an opponent’s Defending card from the playing field before any attacks happen at the end of the Round\n\n
2 through 9\n
Red numbered cards have health equal to their value\n
Black numbered cards deal damage equal to their value\n\n
10\n
Red 10s have 10 health and can have other Defending cards placed in their lane.\n
Black 10s deal 10 damage and can have other Damaging cards placed in their lane.\n\n
Jack\n
Red Jacks have 10 health and allow you to draw an extra card each Turn they are on the board.\n
Black Jacks deal 10 damage and give you 5 extra Energy next Round while also increasing the maximum amount of Energy you carry over next turn to 40.\n\n
Queen\n
Red Queens can move into any open lane at the end of the Round before any Attack cards attack.\n
Black Queens can move into any open lane at the end of the Round before any Attack cards attack.\n\n
King\n
Reg Kings have 10 health and defend their adjacent rows from a single attack completely.\n
Black Kings deal 10 damage and attack adjacent rows for 5 damage\n\n
If a Joker card is played, the opponents next Turn is skipped, no cards or Energy are gained\n
(Jokers are not implemented yet)
